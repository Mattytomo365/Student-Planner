# Student Planner Application

---

## Overview

**Student Planner** is a Python project that will allow students to plan their daily tasks, from general tasks, to academic tasks synced from the user's google calendar. It offers a more student-based interface, focusing on student workflows and daily academic/general task management. This is achieved by integration with the Google Calendar API.

The core functionality of this application centres around a day-to-day checklist, allowing the users to add, edit, categorise, and complete tasks with ease. Certain days can also be visually tagged (e.g. rest day, submission day, deadline day), and tasks will also be tagged (e.g. general, academic). Support for recurring tasks will be introduced (e.g. lectures, study sessions)
