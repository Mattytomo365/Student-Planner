# Student Planner Application

---

## Overview

**Student Planner** a Python project that will allow students to plan their daily tasks, from general tasks, to academic tasks.

The core feature of this application is an interactive calendar. Each day displays a checklist of tasks the user added. Days will be categorised using a visual key (e.g. rest day, submission day, deadline day), and tasks will also be tagged (e.g. general, academic). Support for recurring tasks will be introduced (e.g. lectures, study sessions)
